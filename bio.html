      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>I am a DevOps engineer currently working for the Production Kernel
      Team inside Intel's Open-Source Technology Group. Currently, my job
      includes the following:

      <ul>
          <li>Creating and maintaining build infrastucture with Jenkins.</li>
          <li>Writing a whole bunch of Bash scripts to build the Linux kernel
          on various platforms.</li>
          <li>Writing various Python scripts for the purposes of analytics and
          programmatic interaction with Gerrit, Jira, and TeamForge.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Previous Work History</h2>

      <ul>
          <li>United States Marine Corps, 2009-2014 - 5954 (ATC
          Communications Technician). I fixed all sorts of radios and other
          communications gear for an air traffic control tower in Yuma,
          Arizona. I also cleaned all of the things. </li>
          <li>Intel Corporation, 2014-2018 - Failure Analysis Technician. I used an
          electron microscope to cut pieces out of computer chips and take
          pictures of defects. I also did a fair amount of scripting and data
          analysis, mostly in Python.</li>
