<h3 id="basic-philosophy">Basic Philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The website should be simple. Static webpages should be very lightweight and show text and links. No Jumbotron stuff, no animations. I get that I’m not allowed to style my website like <a href="https://bellard.org/">Fabrice Bellard</a> or <a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/">Larry Wall</a>, but I would if I could.</p></li>
<li><p>Simple styling, standard sans-serif font, small width on the page (Newspapers print in multiple columns for a reason!), reasonable padding. Simple navbar buttons for linking.</p></li>
<li><p>Good project descriptions. That’s the whole point of this website, honestly.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies:</h3>
<p>None. It’s vanilla CSS and HTML.</p>
<h3 id="what-worked">What worked:</h3>
<p>Everything that I really wanted to work.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-had-trouble-with">What I had trouble with:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A flawed understanding of margins vs padding. The classroom lecture didn’t go into very much detail on exactly what they involved, and a lot of the online resources also assumed that you can figure it out yourself. This led to a lot of <a href="https://www.dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Fun">Fun</a> before I figured it out.</li>
<li>Getting the navbar buttons to align the way I wanted them to. See above.</li>
<li>A flawed idea of the purpose of buttons vs links. Apparently, you use buttons when triggering something on the page, such as execution of a Javascript executable. You don’t do it for plain ol’ links to other parts of your website. Those are just links.</li>
<li>Getting contact form buttons to take up the proper width of the form and stay aligned properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-few-entries-from-git-diff">A few entries from <code>git diff</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>(Oct 23) Add very basic bio, projects, and contact form page.</li>
<li>(Oct 23) Flesh out the bio page with content.</li>
<li>(Oct 23) Try and fail miserably at styling navbar buttons.</li>
<li>(Oct 24) Fix the navbar buttons by making them not-buttons.</li>
<li>(Oct 24) Add a hover effect to the header buttons, along with modifying the style of the button corresponding to the current page.</li>
<li>(Oct 25) Add Github button to the header bar.</li>
<li>(Oct 25) Align the Contact form to be similar to how the other two pages work.</li>
<li>(Oct 28) Revamp Projects webpage with better descriptions of the things I’ve worked on.</li>
<li>(Oct 31) Add section to Projects page describing a couple of closed-source work projects I’ve worked on.</li>
<li>(Nov 1) Clean up styles further, add Javascript bindings to contact buttons.</li>
<li>(Nov 1) Change button-row display style to Flexbox. It’s just so much easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="checklist-of-objectives">Checklist of Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a repo. YES</li>
<li>Contain an about page with information about yourself. YES</li>
<li>Projects page with projects you have previously worked on. YES</li>
<li>Contact page with a contact form. YES</li>
<li>Technologies covered in class: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. YES</li>
<li>Individual work: YES</li>
<li>Write my own code. YES</li>
<li>At least 8 commits: <code>git log --oneline | wc -l</code> returns <code>24</code>. Most of them were crappy little commits, but it should be more than enough.</li>
<li>Keep a journal. (See above!)</li>
<li>Links to the public GitHub repo and the deployed site: YES</li>
<li>Time: Well, the labor theory of value is bunk. But I did spend a fair amount of time on this, especially fumbling around with getting alignment correct. YES</li>
</ul>
